\begin{abstract}

  Approach is described to efficiently compute aerothermodynamic design
sensitivities using a decoupled approach.  In this approach, the species
continuity equations are decoupled from the mixture continuity, momentum, and
total energy equations for the Roe flux difference splitting scheme in both the
flow and adjoint solvers. This decoupling simplifies the implicit system, so
that the flow solver can be made significantly more efficient, with very little
penalty on overall scheme robustness.  Most importantly, the computational cost
of the point implicit relaxation is shown to scale linearly with the number of
species for the decoupled system, whereas the fully coupled approach scales
quadratically. Also, the decoupled method significantly reduces the cost in wall
time and memory in comparison to the fully coupled approach. 

A design optimization of a re-entry vehicle with a annular nozzle on the
forebody is completed based on this approach.  The sensitivities of the drag
coefficient and surface temperature with respect to a plenum inboard the vehicle
were computed and verified against complex-variable finite-difference.

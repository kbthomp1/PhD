\chapter{Verification of Adjoint Sensitivity Gradients}
\label{chapter-six}

In this section the sensitivity gradients computed by the adjoint-formulation
are verified against frechet derivatives with complex step.  This details the
methods by which the gradient information is computed in the forward-mode and in
the reverse-mode.

\section{Forward-mode Sensitivities Using Complex-Variables}

The sensitivities can be computed in the forward-mode by using
finite-difference.  While this approach is unfavorable to use in practice,
because a minimum number of flow solves equivalent to the number of design
variables are required, it is a straight-forward way to verify that
sensitivities computed by the adjoint solver are correct.  To avoid cancellation
errors associated with real-variable finite difference, a complex variable
perturbation can be applied
